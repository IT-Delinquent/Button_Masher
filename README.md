### A simple game where two people race to press their respective keys 100 times

This is a simple game where two people both have to "mash" their respective buttons as fast as possible. Currently, player one (left) has to mash the A button and player two (right) has to mash the L button. I want to try and add the functionality for the players to change the key they need to press, but I havne't got round to it yet.
