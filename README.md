### A simple game where two people race to press their respective keys 100 times

This is a simple game where two people both have to "mash" their respective buttons as fast as possible âš¡ 

This is how the game is currently played:

- ![#2ecc71](https://placehold.it/15/2ecc71/000000?text=+) `Player One (Left) has to mash the A key`
- ![#3498db](https://placehold.it/15/3498db/000000?text=+) `Player Two (Right) has to mash the L key`

There is still some functionality that could be added to this but I just haven't got round to it yet. You can see the current program in the gif below:
